## 1. Code Issues

### 1.1. Incomplete Refactoring of API Server

*   **Issue:** The core API server logic is split between a monolithic file (`scripts/core/api-server.js`) and a newer, modular structure (`scripts/core/app.js` and `scripts/core/routes/`). The `/api/recommendations/discover` endpoint is only present in the old monolithic file, indicating that the refactoring was not completed.
*   **Impact:** This creates confusion, makes maintenance difficult, and could lead to inconsistent behavior.
*   **Recommendation:** Complete the refactoring by moving the `/api/recommendations/discover` endpoint and any other missing routes from `scripts/core/api-server.js` to the new modular structure under `scripts/core/routes/`. Deprecate and remove the old `api-server.js` file.

**SuperClaude Prompt:**

```
/sc:refactor --file-path "scripts/core/api-server.js" --new-file-path "scripts/core/routes/recommendations.js" --description "Move the /api/recommendations/discover endpoint from the monolithic api-server.js to a new recommendations.js route file. Update app.js to use the new route."
```

### 1.2. `TODO` for Persistence in Serverless Environment

*   **Issue:** The `saveBooks` function in `src/core/book-manager.js` has a `TODO` to implement Firebase/Supabase persistence for serverless environments. Currently, it only logs the operation and returns `true`, meaning no data is actually saved in a serverless deployment.
*   **Impact:** The application will not function correctly in a serverless environment, which is one of the desired deployment targets.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement the Firebase persistence logic as intended. This aligns with the project goal of using Firebase as the main knowledge base.

**SuperClaude Prompt:**

```
/sc:implement --file-path "src/core/book-manager.js" --function "saveBooks" --description "Implement Firebase persistence in the saveBooks function to handle data storage in a serverless environment. Use the existing Firebase configuration."
```

### 1.3. Deprecated `api` directory

*   **Issue:** The `api` directory at the root of the project appears to be deprecated. The routing logic has been moved to `scripts/core/app.js` and `scripts/core/routes/`.
*   **Impact:** The presence of this directory is misleading and adds clutter to the project.
*   **Recommendation:** After confirming that no essential, unique logic remains in the `api` directory, delete it.

**SuperClaude Prompt:**

```
/sc:delete --path "api" --description "Delete the deprecated 'api' directory from the project root."
```

## 2. Documentation Issues

### 2.1. Outdated and Redundant Documentation

*   **Issue:** The `docs` folder is disorganized and contains a mix of high-level plans, detailed guides, and reports. Several documents are redundant or outdated, and the `archived` folder contains even more.
*   **Impact:** It's difficult to find the current, authoritative source of information. This can lead to confusion for both human developers and the AI assistant.
*   **Recommendation:** I will propose a comprehensive reorganization of the `docs` folder.

### 2.2. Documentation Reorganization

*   **Issue:** The `docs` folder is cluttered, with a mix of high-level plans, technical guides, reports, and AI-specific instructions. This makes it difficult to locate authoritative information and creates a noisy context for the AI assistant.
*   **Impact:** Reduced developer efficiency and potential for the AI assistant to use outdated or irrelevant information.
*   **Recommendation:** Reorganize the `docs` directory by function, with a clear separation between project-level, developer-focused, and AI assistant-specific documentation. This will improve maintainability and provide a clean, dedicated knowledge base for the assistant.

**Proposed Structure:**

```
/docs
├── assistant/         # Knowledge base exclusively for the AI assistant
│   ├── instructions/    # Core operational guides for the AI
│   └── examples/        # Concrete examples for AI workflows
├── development/       # Technical documentation for human developers
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── guides/
│   └── protocols/
├── project/           # High-level project management and planning
├── reports/           # Generated reports (no change)
└── archive/           # All outdated and irrelevant files
```

**SuperClaude Prompts to Reorganize Documentation:**

1.  **Create New Directories:**

    ```
    /sc:run --command "mkdir -p docs/assistant/instructions docs/assistant/examples docs/development/architecture docs/development/guides docs/development/protocols docs/project"
    ```

2.  **Move Files to `docs/project/`:**

    ```
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/workflows/Project_Plan.md docs/project/Project_Plan.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/workflows/Task_Management_Guide.md docs/project/Task_Management_Guide.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/README.md docs/project/README.md"
    ```

3.  **Move Files to `docs/development/`:**

    ```
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/CI-CD.md docs/development/guides/CI-CD.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/DEPLOYMENT.md docs/development/guides/Deployment.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/workflows/Session_Workflow_Protocol.md docs/development/protocols/Session_Workflow_Protocol.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv BACKEND_AUDIT_REPORT.md docs/development/architecture/BACKEND_AUDIT_REPORT.md"
    ```

4.  **Move Files to `docs/assistant/`:**

    ```
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/guides/Operating_Instructions.md docs/assistant/instructions/Operating_Instructions.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/guides/conversational-interface-patterns.md docs/assistant/instructions/Conversational_Patterns.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/guides/backfill-strategy-guide.md docs/assistant/instructions/Backfill_Strategy.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/guides/ai-classification-demo.md docs/assistant/examples/AI_Classification_Demo.md"
    /sc:run --command "mv docs/guides/fuzzy-classification-examples.md docs/assistant/examples/Fuzzy_Classification_Examples.md"
    ```

5.  **Clean Up Old Directories and Redundant Files:**

    ```
    /sc:run --command "rm -rf docs/workflows docs/guides"
    /sc:run --command "rm docs/reports/P2-B2_Library_Integration_Report.md docs/reports/summary.md"
    ```

## 3. SuperClaude Workflow & Task Management Issues

*   **Issue:** The current workflow documents (`CLAUDE.md`, `Session_Workflow_Protocol.md`, `Task_Management_Guide.md`) are detailed but lack the explicit, atomic instructions needed to prevent an AI like SuperClaude from going on tangents or skipping steps. The system relies on the AI to infer the next action from a large context, leading to inconsistent behavior.
*   **Impact:** Inefficient development cycles, incomplete tasks, and a lack of predictable behavior from the AI assistant.
*   **Analysis:** SuperClaude, like many large language models, performs best with clear, sequential, and granular instructions. The current documents provide high-level goals but don't break them down into the small, verifiable steps that an AI needs to follow rigorously. The lack of a "pause and await confirmation" step is a key reason why it completes multiple steps when only one was requested.
*   **Recommendation:** Revise the core workflow documents to be more prescriptive and structured. Introduce explicit command-and-control mechanisms that guide the AI step-by-step.

### 3.1. Proposed Changes to `CLAUDE.md`

*   **Change:** Add a new, prominent section at the top: `SESSION COMMAND PROTOCOL`. This section will define a strict, numbered sequence for the AI to follow.
*   **Rationale:** This makes the expected workflow unambiguous and forces the AI to proceed sequentially.

**SuperClaude Prompt:**

```
/sc:replace --file-path "CLAUDE.md" --old-string "## How to Use This File" --new-string "# SESSION COMMAND PROTOCOL\n\n**IMPORTANT: Follow these steps sequentially. Do not proceed to the next step without explicit user confirmation.**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Task:** State the task you are about to perform based on the `Task_Management_Guide.md`.\n2.  **Request Plan Approval:** Present a concise, numbered plan to accomplish the task. Await user approval before proceeding.\n3.  **Execute Step-by-Step:** Execute the plan one step at a time. After each tool use or code modification, state the outcome and wait for the user to provide the next command (e.g., `/continue`, `/test`, `/commit`).\n4.  **Verify Changes:** After implementing changes, run relevant tests (`/sc:test`) or validation commands as specified in the plan.\n5.  **Update Task Guide:** Upon completion, generate the command to update the `Task_Management_Guide.md` to mark the task as 'COMPLETED'.\n\n## How to Use This File"
```

### 3.2. Proposed Changes to `docs/workflows/Task_Management_Guide.md`

*   **Change:** For each task, add a `## SuperClaude Implementation Plan` section with pre-defined, atomic steps. This provides the AI with a ready-made, approved plan to follow.
*   **Rationale:** This removes the ambiguity of the AI having to create its own plan, which is a major source of deviation. It turns the AI's job from 'planning and executing' to just 'executing a pre-approved plan'.

**SuperClaude Prompt (Example for one task):**

```
/sc:replace --file-path "docs/workflows/Task_Management_Guide.md" --old-string "**Description**: Implement RSS intake → book completion → preference prompts → learning cycle" --new-string "**Description**: Implement RSS intake → book completion → preference prompts → learning cycle\n\n**SuperClaude Implementation Plan:**\n1.  Read `scripts/core/rss-ingest.js` to understand the current RSS logic.\n2.  Create a new file `scripts/core/preference-prompter.js` to handle the logic for generating preference-learning prompts.\n3.  Modify `scripts/core/rss-ingest.js` to call the new prompter service when a book is marked as 'Finished'.\n4.  Add a new API endpoint `/api/preferences/prompts` to expose the generated prompts.\n5.  Run tests to validate the new workflow."
```

### 3.3. Proposed Changes to `docs/workflows/Session_Workflow_Protocol.md`

*   **Change:** Simplify the protocol to focus on the new command-driven interaction model. Replace the lengthy checklists with a clear directive to follow the `SESSION COMMAND PROTOCOL` in `CLAUDE.md`.
*   **Rationale:** This streamlines the documentation, removes redundancy, and reinforces the new, more explicit workflow.

**SuperClaude Prompt:**

```
/sc:write --file-path "docs/workflows/Session_Workflow_Protocol.md" --content "# Session Workflow Protocol\n\n**Version:** 2.0\n\n## Core Principle\n\nAll development sessions are driven by a sequential, command-based interaction model. The AI assistant must follow the steps outlined in the `SESSION COMMAND PROTOCOL` section of `CLAUDE.md` at all times.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Session Start:** The user will provide a task from the `Task_Management_Guide.md`.\n2.  **AI Execution:** The AI assistant will follow the `SESSION COMMAND PROTOCOL` in `CLAUDE.md` to plan, execute, and verify the task step-by-step, awaiting user confirmation at each stage.\n3.  **Session End:** The session concludes when the task is marked as 'COMPLETED' in the `Task_Management_Guide.md`."
```
