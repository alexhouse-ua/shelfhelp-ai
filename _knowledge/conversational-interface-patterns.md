# Mobile-First Conversational Interface Patterns

## Overview

ShelfHelp AI is designed for natural language interactions through ChatGPT, Claude, and mobile chat interfaces. The system is RSS-driven - finished books and ratings come automatically from Goodreads RSS feed, triggering reflection workflows.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. RSS-Driven Automation
- **Finished Books**: Detected automatically from RSS feed with ratings
- **Reflection Triggers**: Prompted when new finished books appear
- **User Focus**: TBR management, recommendations, analytics queries
- **Natural Language**: Flexible input, no rigid command structure

### 2. Mobile-Optimized Responses
- **Concise**: Under 2000 characters for mobile readability
- **Structured**: Bullet points, emojis, progressive disclosure
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps and quick options

## Primary User Workflows

**Natural Language Examples:**
- "Add Iron Flame to my TBR"
- "Put that hockey romance at the top of my queue"
- "Remove this book from my list"

- "Show me my TBR queue"

**AI Response Pattern:**
```
