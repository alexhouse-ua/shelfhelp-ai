# Mobile-First Conversational Interface Patterns

## Overview

ShelfHelp AI is designed for natural language interactions through ChatGPT, Claude, and mobile chat interfaces. The system is RSS-driven - finished books and ratings come automatically from Goodreads RSS feed, triggering reflection workflows.

### 1. RSS-Driven Automation
- **Finished Books**: Detected automatically from RSS feed with ratings
- **Reflection Triggers**: Prompted when new finished books appear

- **Actionable**: Clear next steps and quick options
