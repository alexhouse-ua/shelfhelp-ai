}
```

## AI Decision Tree Demonstration

### High Confidence (>90%): Auto-classify
- **Example**: Clear genre indicators from multiple sources
- **Action**: Automatic classification with detailed source attribution
- **Coverage**: ~60% of books

### Medium Confidence (70-90%): Suggest for review  
- **Example**: Some conflicting information between sources
- **Action**: Present findings with reasoning for human review
- **Coverage**: ~25% of books

### Low Confidence (<70%): Enhanced user prompt
- **Example**: Limited web information available
- **Action**: Generate detailed prompt with AI research findings
- **Coverage**: ~15% of books

## Efficiency Metrics

### Traditional Manual Process:
- ⏱️ **Time per book**: 3-5 minutes manual research
- 📊 **Daily capacity**: ~100 books (8 hours)
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: Variable, depends on user knowledge

### AI-Enhanced Process:
- ⏱️ **Time per book**: 30-60 seconds automated research
- 📊 **Daily capacity**: ~1,000+ books (with rate limiting)
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: 88%+ confidence with source validation
- 📈 **Consistency**: Standardized taxonomy compliance

## Key Advantages Demonstrated

1. **Autonomous Operation**: AI performs comprehensive research without human intervention
