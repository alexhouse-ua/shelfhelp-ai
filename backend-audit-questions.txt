# ShelfHelp AI Backend Audit - Questions for Clarification

## Project Usage & Priorities

### Core Usage Patterns
1. **Primary Use Case**: What's your main workflow? 
   - Manual book entry → AI classification → queue management?
   - RSS automation → reading completion → preference learning?
   - AI assistant conversations for book discovery?
   * All of the above. Read books will always come from RSS. 
   These books may or may not be on my TBR or listed as reading. 
   TBR will always be through the AI assistant, whether I tell it to add to my TBR or I tell it to add based on its recommendations

2. **Interface Preferences**: Which interfaces do you actually use?
   - CustomGPT via ChatGPT Plus (mobile/web)?
   - Direct API calls via tools?
   - Web dashboard (if we build one)?
   *Either CustomGPT or another custom ai assistant buildable for free.

3. **Reading Workflow**: How do you typically use the system?
   - Add books → get recommendations → read → reflect?
   - Bulk import → classify → organize → discover?
   - Real-time queue management during reading sessions?
   *Add books → get recommendations → read → reflect. I also want recommendations not currently added.

## Technical Configuration & Preferences

### External Services
4. **Library Systems**: Which libraries do you actually use?
   - Tuscaloosa Public Library (configured in .env)?
   - Camellia Net (configured in .env)?
   - Seattle Public Library (configured in .env)?
   - Or should we focus on different libraries?
   *Those three libraries are correct. We will need to test these, as the configuration is not accurate, though it appears to work through false answer.

5. **Subscription Services**: Which services do you actively use?
   - Kindle Unlimited (KU checking priority)?
   - Hoopla Digital (which library system)?
   - Audible/other audiobook services?
   *I have all of the above. Hoopla can be done through Tuscaloosa or Seattle.

6. **Firebase Setup**: Do you want real-time sync?
   - Firebase credentials available for setup?
   - Prefer local-only storage for privacy?
   - Multi-device sync important?
   *I want real-time sync, as long as I can do it under the free limitations. I will mainly be using my phone to interact with the AI assistant, so it needs to be available on multiple devices.

### Data & Privacy
7. **Data Retention**: How much history do you want to keep?
   - All reading history indefinitely?
   - Recent books only (last 2 years)?
   - Specific data minimization preferences?
   *All reading history indefinitely.

8. **Backup Strategy**: How do you want data protected?
   - Git-based backup (current approach)?
   - Cloud storage integration?
   - Export capabilities for data portability?
   *Git-based backup is okay for now, but will like to put in some failsafes.

## Feature Priorities & Preferences

### AI Integration
9. **Recommendation Style**: What type of recommendations work best?
   - Similar books based on recent reads?
   - Mood-based suggestions?
   - Seasonal/themed recommendations?
   - Discovery of new genres/authors?
   *Mainly similar books and mood-based, but I also am open to seasonal/themed for vibe reading. I would like to largely stick to romance, but am not limited on authors I want to read. I am open to most all, unless I state otherwise.

10. **Classification Granularity**: How detailed should book metadata be?
    - Genre/subgenre sufficient?
    - Detailed tropes and themes?
    - Spice level tracking important?
    - Reading difficulty/complexity scoring?
    *As detailed as it can be. Reading difficulty is not important, but subgenre, tropes, themes, tone and spice are all important.

### Queue Management
11. **Queue Organization**: How do you prefer to organize your TBR?
    - Priority-based ranking?
    - Mood/genre-based grouping?
    - Availability-based sorting (library/KU first)?
    - Series completion tracking?
    *All of the above should be integrated.

12. **Availability Checking**: How important is real-time availability?
    - Critical for decision-making?
    - Nice-to-have background feature?
    - Prefer manual checking to avoid API costs?
    *Nice to have, but it can be once daily or as needed checks, for example, when I add to my TBR, I would like to know if I need to put the book on hold at a library and it positions it in my queue based on the wait time.

### Reflection & Analytics
13. **Reading Insights**: What analytics interest you most?
    - Reading pace and goal tracking?
    - Genre preference evolution?
    - Author discovery patterns?
    - Seasonal reading trends?
    *All of the above and more. I want very detailed analytics for myself and the assistant to learn my reading patterns.

14. **Reflection Prompts**: How do you want to capture thoughts?
    - Automated prompts after book completion?
    - Manual reflection when inspired?
    - Structured templates vs. free-form?
    *Automated prompts after book completion. It should be structured enough that the ai assistant can learn my preferences and create its own rating system and deliver continuously improving recommendations, but I am open to bespoke questions based on the type of book I read.

## Current Pain Points

### System Issues
15. **Performance Problems**: What feels slow or clunky?
    - Book classification speed?
    - Recommendation generation time?
    - API response times?
    - File loading/saving delays?
    *Because of the limitations of fetching the database, I am concerned it won't be able to deliver recommendations and analytics. We need to find a way for it to run data on the entire database and store documented knowledge on my preferences that it can continually review and update.

16. **Data Quality Issues**: What needs improvement?
    - Incomplete book metadata?
    - Inaccurate classifications?
    - Duplicate entries?
    - Missing availability info?
    *Incomplete book metadata. we need to work on how it's pulling in information.

### User Experience
17. **Workflow Friction**: What steps feel tedious?
    - Manual book entry process?
    - Classification validation?
    - Queue reordering?
    - Reflection writing?
    *Not all have been tested, so I'm not sure.

18. **Missing Features**: What capabilities do you wish existed?
    - Better mobile interface?
    - Voice input for quick adds?
    - Integration with other reading apps?
    - Social features (sharing, following)?
    *I don't want any of this at this moment. This will always be a personal app. remove all references to social or multi-user support.

## Technical Constraints & Preferences

### Development Approach
19. **Coding Style**: Given your "vibe coder" preference:
    - Prefer simple, readable code over complex optimizations?
    - Want extensive comments and documentation?
    - Need step-by-step deployment guides?
    - Prefer modular, easy-to-modify structure?
    *I want accuracy and verification to ensure it will work. 

20. **Maintenance Level**: How much ongoing maintenance do you want?
    - Set-and-forget automation?
    - Regular tweaking and optimization?
    - Continuous feature development?
    - Minimal maintenance mode?
    *Would rather set-and-forget. My hope would be that I only have to use the AI assistant and not touch the backend, unless something major happens.

### Deployment & Hosting
21. **Hosting Preferences**: Where do you want to deploy?
    - Railway (current setup)?
    - Vercel for API endpoints?
    - Local development only?
    - Other hosting platforms?
    *I don't care, whatever makes it free and available on-the-go.

22. **Cost Tolerance**: What's your budget for external services?
    - Zero additional costs beyond current subscriptions?
    - Small monthly fees for enhanced features?
    - Pay-per-use APIs acceptable?
    *Zero additional costs beyond current subscriptions.
