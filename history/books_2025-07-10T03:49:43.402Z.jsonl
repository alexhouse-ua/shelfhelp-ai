Never one to overstay her welcome (or expect much from a man), Aurora slips away before Russ even has the chance to ask for her full name. <br /><br />Imagine their surprise when they bump into each other on the first day of the summer camp where they are both counselors, hoping to escape their complicated home lives by spending the summer working. Russ hopes if he gets far enough away from Maple Hills, he can avoid dealing with the repercussions of his father’s gambling addiction, while Aurora is tired of craving attention from everyone around her, and wants to go back to the last place she truly felt at home. <br /><br />Russ knows breaking the camp’s strict “no staff fraternizing” rule will have him heading back to Maple Hills before the summer is over, but unfortunately for him, Aurora has never been very good at caring about the rules. Will the two learn to peacefully coexist? Or did their one night together start a fire they can’t put out?","isbn":"1668026287","average_rating":3.91,"book_published":2023,"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7657379307?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","pubdate":"2025-06-17T11:27:27.000Z","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1692088661l/111172922._SY75_.jpg","genre":null,"subgenre":null,"tropes":[],"spice":null,"queue_position":13,"queue_priority":null,"liked":null,"disliked":null,"notes":null,"updated_at":"2025-07-10T03:43:11.717Z","added_at":"2025-07-08T19:48:18.605Z"},{"guid":"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7411311838?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss","goodreads_id":"7411311838","title":"Not Another Love Song","author_name":"Julie  Soto","series_name":null,"series_number":null,"status":"TBR","book_description":"<b>Two string players fight their attraction for each other as they compete for center stage in this spicy and emotional romance.</b><br /><br />Gwen Jackson and Xander Thorne are both musical prodigies, but each has had very different paths to success.

That will be my curse. <br /><br />But it’s time to confess, to myself more so than any other, that I’d hindered my chances because of the way I was built, and because of the men who built me. <br /><br />At this point, I just want to make peace with who I am, no matter what ending I get.
