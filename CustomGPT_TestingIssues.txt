“I attempted to add Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros to your library, but the system encountered a read-only file error and couldn't save it.
You can retry later, or I can help you track this manually or prepare a list of pending additions if you'd like!”

*I also want to make sure when I request to add a book, it automatically does a web search to get its details from Goodreads, as well as the ai-assisted enchanted data.

3.3

I did not get a book ID from 3.1, nor is that information I will know off the top of my head. I tried it with a book title instead, and got the below response. This should be refined to work with other fields besides book id.“There was an issue retrieving detailed data for "Severed Heart" by Kate Stewart. However, here's what I can provide from your library:
* Title: Severed Heart
* Author: Kate Stewart
* Series: Ravenhood Legacy #2
* Genre: Romance (Dark/Suspenseful)
* Average Rating: 4.81
* Your Rating: 5
* Pages: 748
* Date Read: June 29, 2025
* Description:This book delves into Tyler’s story within the Ravenhood Legacy. It narrates his transformation from a boy with ambition to a man shaped by love and loss. It's an intense continuation of a darkly seductive series.
If you'd like, I can help find similar books or dig deeper into the Ravenhood universe.”

3.4

Same issues as 3.3. I tried using a book title that was in my database as TBR, and received this response:
“I wasn't able to locate "Bright Side" by Kim Holden in your library due to technical issues retrieving your full book list. Would you like me to add it for you and mark it as Currently Reading?”

3.5

I received this response for the test prompt:“I'm currently unable to retrieve your unclassified books due to a system limitation. However, I can help you classify a specific book manually. Just share the title (and author if possible), and I'll handle the rest. Would you like to proceed that way?”

I responded with a book title to test the manual one, and got the following response:
“Error talking to connector

To classify "Severed Heart", I need both the title and the author explicitly. Here's what I have:

* Author: Kate Stewart

The classification attempt for "Severed Heart" by Kate Stewart didn’t return a confident match for genre, subgenre, or tropes.
If you’d like, I can reclassify it using web research to ensure accuracy. Shall I go ahead with that?

Yes.

It seems the AI classification still failed due to a validation issue. To work around this, I can manually research and classify "Severed Heart" by Kate Stewart for you. Let me do that now.

4.2

It had the following response where it failed to classify the book, but searched the web to classify the book, however the below result did not correctly match the classifications to the classification.yaml options. It also didn’t seem to look up the spice level from the correct source. Spice should come from Romance.io.

Would you like me to save this classification for Beach Read in your library? Or apply these genres/tropes to other books in your collection?”

When I tried to save the classification, I got the following error:

“The system encountered an error while trying to save the classification for Beach Read—it couldn’t create the book entry due to a technical issue.
Would you like me to retry later, or would you prefer a downloadable note of the classification for your records?”

4.3

“It looks like the system couldn't process the genre match request due to a validation error. However, I can manually list the main genre categories that match or are subtypes of Romance:”

*Note, the subgenres it brought up did not match the classifications.yaml.

4.4

Same issue as previous ones, where I will not have the book ID on hand and it is not feasible for it to be used. I used with a book title instead and got the following response, where it first said the wrong author, and then did not do the research correctly, as the previous classification task above:

“It has a beautiful Italian beach setting and it was fun to see characters … but I found the different timelines confusing and the discourse around their big age gap repetitive.” All About Romance

Would you like me to save this classification to your library metadata for Problematic Summer Romance?”

5.*

I am unable to test these as they are not currently assigned, and I could not get it to assign them to my queue based on lack of backfill data and preferences analysis yet. This may indicate that we need to assign handling rules for the queue. For example, I want it to automatically add a book to the end of my queue when added or status is changed to TBR. I also want to be able to tell it to re-analyze and re-order my queue on a recurring basis as my preferences change or on demand if my mood shifts. I also don’t understand the difference between intelligent vs smart vs basic queue and am not sure if they are all necessary. Overall, I am having write access issues, and was not successful in asking it to pull my TBR or manually assign a book to a queue position.

6.1

I got a 500 error, not a 404.

6.2

I got a 500 error: EROFS: read-only file system, open '/var/task/data/books.json’.

However, I want to be able to tell it to add a title, it automatically look up the required info prior to writing it to the database. If the book is inconclusive on which one it is, it will provide me the options. For example, if I ask to add Caught Up to my TBR, it would ask if I meant the one by Navessa Allen or Liz Tomforde.

7.1

I am not sure how to monitor this. I will need further assistance.
